# work-day-scheduler

## Description

This Project is for Challenge 05 of the Monash Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. In this challenge we have been asked to create a calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a work day. The scheduler displays the current day and the time blocks are color-coded based on the current hour of the day. when the user enters their input into a time block and clicks the save button, their input is saved to local storage and is reloaded when returning to the page.
